# Exercise 10 â€“ Moving Average Filter Analysis

This repository contains a MATLAB solution template for **Exercise 10**, which demonstrates the analysis of moving average (MA) filters using **frequency response** and **zero-pole analysis**.

## ðŸ“˜ Problem Description
We are given two finite impulse response (FIR) filters:

- **5-point moving average filter**  
  \( b_1 = [1 \ 1 \ 1 \ 1 \ 1], \ a_1 = 1 \)

- **9-point moving average filter**  
  \( b_2 = [1 \ 1 \ 1 \ 1 \ 1 \ 1 \ 1 \ 1 \ 1], \ a_2 = 1 \)

### Tasks
1. Normalize the filters to convert them into **averaging filters**.  
2. Use `freqz` to plot their **magnitude responses**.  
3. Use `tf2zpk` and `zplane` to perform **zero-pole analysis**.  
4. Compare the two filters in terms of their frequency behavior and pole-zero locations.
